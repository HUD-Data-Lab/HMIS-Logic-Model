# HMIS-Logic-Model

The HMIS Logical Model exists to define normative relationships for the HUD HMIS data elements, independent of any technical implementation considerations. The model is intended to technically express the underlying constraints described in the HMIS Data Standards Model and the HMIS Data Dictionary.

You can use the HMIS Logical Model to:
●	quickly get an overview of the HMIS data structures and how the relate to each other
●	map between HMIS and other existing models for interoperability purposes
