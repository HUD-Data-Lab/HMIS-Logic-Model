# HMIS-Logic-Model

## Disclaimers
HMIS Logic Model development is related to HUD Data Lab initiatives concerning machine-readable documentation and cross-system interoperability. Its scope and degree of articulation depends on how it will be integrated with the overall suite of tools being developed to support these use cases. It is expected that the overall structure and supported functionality of the Logic Model will continue to evolve in response to related tool development, community engagement, and use case refinement.

The Logic Model was originally developed as part of the implementation of the FY2022 HMIS Data Standards. No changes were made during the FY2024 revision cycle. FY2026 updates focused on updating the class and property lists to mirror changes made to data elements in the FY2026 HMIS Data Standards. The “Differences from past versions of the HMIS Logical Models” section identifies components of the Logic Model that are different from the FY2022 Logic Model and provides context for these design decisions.
